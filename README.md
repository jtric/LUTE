 Linguistic Unique Tokenizing Explicator

You are welcome to download this code and play around with it as part of learning Java or basal compiler concepts such
as tokens, tokenizing, and semantics.

However, you may NOT use this code as part of any public projects (personal OR commercial) or academic projects
(e.g., things that receive a grade and academic credit). You may NOT fork, rehost/redistribute, or otherwise include
this project in anything else.

This repository is an archive for posterity, not an active development.

Learning from others' code is recommended. Plagiarising others' code for academic grade points is not.
